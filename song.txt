Run, boy, run! This world is not made for you
Run, boy, run! They're trying to catch you
Run, boy, run! Running is a victory
Run, boy, run! Beauty lies behind the hills

Run, boy, run! The sun will be guiding you
Run, boy, run! They're dying to stop you
Run, boy, run! This race is a prophecy
Run, boy, run! Break out from society

Tomorrow is another day
And you don't have to hide away
You'll be a man, boy
But for now, it's time to run, it's time to run
